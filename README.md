# Support Network

[![Build Status](https://build.developer.rackspace.com/rackerlabs/docs-support-network/badge?branch=master)](https://build.developer.rackspace.com/rackerlabs/docs-support-network/)

A Deconst based landing site for http://support.rackspace.com.

# Viewing the Site

A quick test to view the content locally you can use `jekyll`:

    $ jekyll serve --watch

This may not look like the final rendering though because assets and templates
are pulled in from the
[nexus-control](https://github.com/rackerlabs/nexus-control) repository.  To
view that result you should use
[deconst-client](https://github.com/deconst/client).
